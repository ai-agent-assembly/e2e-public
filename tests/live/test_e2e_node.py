"""Live SDK→runtime policy-enforcement E2E for the **Node** SDK (AAASM-3152).

Production-path E2E for the Node SDK: prove the SDK and the real core agree on a
policy decision, not merely that ``@agent-assembly/sdk`` resolves. Unlike the
Python SDK (whose native ``_core`` is importable into this process), the Node SDK
is driven through its own toolchain (``node``/``pnpm``) against a checkout, so the
live paths skip cleanly — with a *justified* env-requirement reason — when the
toolchain or the SDK checkout is absent.

Layers mirror ``test_e2e_python.py``:

* **offline** — the shared allow/deny policy loads + resolves correctly (green in
  a bare ``-m e2e`` run).
* **allow path (live)** — needs ``node``/``pnpm`` + a built Node SDK; skips
  cleanly (justified) otherwise.
* **deny path (live, strict-xfail)** — pinned xfail on the product gaps so it
  never yields a false green.

Known product gaps that make the deny path unprovable today (AC4) — shared
across all three SDKs via ``aa-sdk-client``:

* **AAASM-3000** — SDK⇄aa-runtime IPC deadlock (``close()`` hangs, no events).
* **AAASM-3021** — SDK pre-execution ``check()`` unwired: the Node SDK's
  ``createNoopGatewayClient`` always returns ``{denied: false}``, so a denied
  action is not blocked at the SDK layer.

AAASM-3172 will flip the deny-path xfail to a hard assert once a fixed SDK
release ships — see the marker on ``test_node_deny_path_blocks_restricted_tool``.
